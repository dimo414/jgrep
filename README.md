# jGrep

jGrep is a cross-platform graphical file search utility, modeled after
[`grep`](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html), but built from the ground up
in Java. It lets you quickly search for either a string of text or matches to a regular
expression in a single file or a directory in an easy and intuitive user interface.
Additional features include a find/replace utility and the ability to save and load past
searches.

You can download the jGrep Jar from the
[Releases](https://github.com/dimo414/jgrep/releases) page. There
is also a Windows installer for Windows users.

The source is currently built by "hand" with `javac`, see the
[build action](https://github.com/dimo414/jgrep/blob/483074a/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L14)
for an example command if trying to build from source.
