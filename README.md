# jGrep

You can download the jGrep Jar from the
[Releases](https://github.com/dimo414/jgrep/releases) page. There
is also a Windows installer for Windows users.

The source is currently built by "hand" with `javac`, see the
[build action](https://github.com/dimo414/jgrep/blob/483074a/.github/workflows/cd.yml#L14)
for an example command if trying to build from source.
